Since Zethus is a web interface, it does not require a local installation of ROS.  
It can run on any device with a modern browser. Although the performance may vary based on the device hardware

## Recommended requirements
* A discrete graphics card with at least 512 MB of video memory  
* A modern browser that [supports WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#search=webgl)  
* An unauthenticated [rosbridge server](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_server) endpoint for subscribing to sensor data
