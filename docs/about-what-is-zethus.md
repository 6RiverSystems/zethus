title: What is Zethus?
---

Zethus is a web application for displaying sensor data and state information from ROS. In a lot of ways it's similar to RViz. It supports most of the display types supported by RViz.

## How did it come to be?

Zethus was initially built as a library to visualize ROS messages across multiple web projects in development at Rapyuta Robotics. We realised there's a void in the community for ROS based web visualizations and tools. So we worked for a few weeks to make it more generic and open source it. Hope it helps you with your projects and makes us one step closer to more accessible robots and more widespread use of robotic tools.
